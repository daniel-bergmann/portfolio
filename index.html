                        <p>
                            “Deep work is necessary to writing every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity”

                            The book Deep Work by Cal Newport was written for people that want to maximize their productivity in the least amount of time<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> . Learn a new skill or just simply get more done in an ever increasing distracted world.
                            
                            No other book has influenced the way I look at work and continuous studying more than this piece of literature. Although no book is perfect, I would gladly place this book amongst the golden nuggets of productivity books. I have read it two times and I find the case studies found in this book very useful. 
                            
                            My understanding of how much time I can actually be productive increased gradually after reading the book as I focused on developing a habit of “Deep Work”. Gradually day by day I increase the time I focus on my goals and in that time, only focus on one thing at a time to prevent so called “Shallow Work”.
                            
                            Deep Work - Tasks that create new value and hard to replicate, push cognitive capabilities to their limit, performed free from distractions.
                            
                            Shallow Work - Tasks that do not create much new value, easy to replicate, often performed while distracted
                            
                            Cal Newport argues in his book we should all strive to limit Shallow Work and train ourselves to maximize our potential by focusing on Deep Work.
                            
                            In an undistracted Deep Work session you can learn a new skill faster and leverage your current skills to produce more valuable work. With the rise of tools and social media, our personal and professional lives are increasingly fragmenting our attention.
                            
                            Practicing a Deep Work habit is also a stepping stone into a flow state, a source of great satisfaction and value.
                            
                            In order to start practicing Deep Work one must master its habits. Know how they work and how to stick with them. I recommend looking into that and then check out this bombshell of a book.

                        <p>
                        API's are like user interfaces(UI),  but for a machine. Smartphones are designed for a <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">  human to use.
                        <br><br>
                        An API is an alternative to the UI.
                        <br><br>
                        Smartphone UI have UI's that humans find easier to use. Machines have their own as well however a human wouldn't want to use that kind of UI.<br><br>
                        API's are used by the software on your machine to access information on other machines. Your smartphone could also send an API request to a server across the network to access information on there.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand it could be two servers talking to each other. Maybe you have something like SAP(Systems Applications Products) talking through the network to a ecommerce site to exchange some information through networkable API's.
                        <br><br>
