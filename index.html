                <a href="#" class="blog-post"><h2>Material Design</h2></a>

                    <p>
                        Material design is a pretty interesting framework. It was created and designed by Google for developers in the field.<span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5"> It supposedly is combined with the classic principles of successful design, innovation and modern web technology. <br><br>

                        The reason for this is part of Google's goal.<br><br>
                        
                        By creating Material Design, Google wishes to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.<br><br>
                        
                        Design inspired by paper and ink, it provides familiar visual cues that eases users to understand the technology beyond the physical world.<br><br>
                        
                        I really enjoy designing products with materialize because of the user friendliness and the visually pleasing aspect of both the grid system and colors.<br><br>
                        
                        Materialize is fully compatible with JavaScript so designing dynamic web components is easy and very so much possible.<br><br>
                        
                        If you are thinking about learning a framework for UI design I recommend using Materialize over Bootstrap for example because it's more modern and will most likely take over in the field within 5 years.<br><br>
                        
                        I recommend anybody to try it out to see if they like it or not.<br><br>

                    <p>  
                    Lets cover the "Nitty Gritty" of JS fundamentals. <br><br>
                    
                    Conditionals is what JS is famous for. Better known as “if statements”. It's very basic<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">
                    
                        “If something is true, run the following line of code.”<br><br>
                        
                    Booleans will always come out as the final result. So if you have a mathematical   comparison for example it evaluates to a boolean.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    In addition to “if” statements there are “else if” and “else” statements.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    Loops are like repeated if statements without having to manually write out the same thing again and again. It has a condition and will only stop running the code once the condition returns “false”.<br><br>
                    
                    “Do...while” loops, runs the code upside down and checks the condition after it runs the code. <br><br>
                    
                    “Switch statements” give you the ability to write options. <br><br>
                    
                    Functions are the building blocks of a JavaScript application but there are more than one way to write a function. For an example there are arrow functions that make writing your functions shorter. They usually full up one line in the code editor but multiple lines are possible with curly brackets.<br><br>
                    
                    Hope this helps with starting out with Vanilla JS. If you have a question about any of the terminology, reach out to the community because you’re not alone. Or you could ask good ol’ Uncle Google. He’s around 24/7 and can be reached almost anywhere in the world.<br><br>

                        <p>
                        In order to understand line after line of messy computer code, developers have to have a good idea of the basic fundamentals of the programming language they are working with. 

                        As a new developer, learning the fundamental syntax before <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> entering the vast ocean of different frameworks available out there is crucial for success in the field because frameworks keep evolving and changing as time flies by.<br><br>

                            Staying relevant is key so knowing the basics helps.<br><br>
                            
                            Javascript for example has many frameworks out there, probably more than the population of Iceland SO How does one prepare well enough before diving in? In part 1 and part 2 of this article I wish to find out.<br><br>
                            
                            Part 1: The basics<br><br>
                            
                            JavaScript is made up of a series of statements and semicolons.<br><br>
                            
                            Statements are like sentences and the semicolon is like the full stop of that sentence.<br><br>
                            
                            “Use strict” came along with ECMAScript 5 (ES5). ES5 was released in 2009 and new features modified some of the existing ones. By default, modifications are not applied unless you enable it using “use strict”. Place it on top of your code document and that way it’ll get applied. Always do it, unless you are actually from the past travelling to 2020 in a hot-tub time machine.<br><br>
                            
                            Variables hold information. You can use the keyword “let” or “const” to declare a variable and give it a name.<br><br>
                            
                            You can then assign a value to it using “=”.<br><br>
                            
                            Without any assignment, the default is set to undefined. That means the variable is empty and without value.<br><br>
                            
                            The data types in JavaScript are:<br><br>
                            Numbers<br>
                            BigInt<br>
                            Strings<br>
                            Boolean<br>
                            Null<br>
                            Undefined<br>
                            Objects<br>
                            
                            In JavaScript you are able to switch between different types. That process is called type conversion and is as simple as that. <br><br>
                            
                            Operators are similar between most programming languages. Example here:<br><br>
                            
                            AND (&)  OR (|)  XOR (^)  NOT (~)  LEFT SHIFT (<<)  RIGHT SHIFT (>>)  ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT (>>>)<br><br> 
                            
                            Comparisons are very useful and like operators. Very simple stuff. See:<br><br>
                            
                            Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.<br>
                            Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.<br>
                            Equals: a == b (single = sign is an assignment rather than a comparator).<br>
                            Not equals. a != b.<br><br>
                            
                            Alert, prompt and confirm are the ugly pop ups that show up on top of your browser when it’s trying to tell you something.<br><br>
                            
                            Before going onwards in your JS journey it is crucial to master these concepts as they are the building block for development in the field.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            “Deep work is necessary to writing every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity”<br><br>

                            The book Deep Work by Cal Newport was written for people that want to maximize their productivity in the least amount of time<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> . Learn a new skill or just simply get more done in an ever increasing distracted world.<br><br>
                            
                            No other book has influenced the way I look at work and continuous studying more than this piece of literature. Although no book is perfect, I would gladly place this book amongst the golden nuggets of productivity books. I have read it two times and I find the case studies found in this book very useful. <br><br>
                            
                            My understanding of how much time I can actually be productive increased gradually after reading the book as I focused on developing a habit of “Deep Work”. Gradually day by day I increase the time I focus on my goals and in that time, only focus on one thing at a time to prevent so called “Shallow Work”.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Deep Work</strong> - Tasks that create new value and hard to replicate, push cognitive capabilities to their limit, performed free from distractions.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Shallow Work</strong> - Tasks that do not create much new value, easy to replicate, often performed while distracted.<br><br>
                            
                            Cal Newport argues in his book we should all strive to limit Shallow Work and train ourselves to maximize our potential by focusing on Deep Work.<br><br>
                            
                            In an undistracted Deep Work session you can learn a new skill faster and leverage your current skills to produce more valuable work. With the rise of tools and social media, our personal and professional lives are increasingly fragmenting our attention.<br><br>
                            
                            Practicing a Deep Work habit is also a stepping stone into a flow state, a source of great satisfaction and value.<br><br>
                            
                            In order to start practicing Deep Work one must master its habits. Know how they work and how to stick with them. I recommend looking into that and then check out this bombshell of a book.

                        <p>
                        API's are like user interfaces(UI),  but for a machine. Smartphones are designed for a <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">  human to use.
                        <br><br>
                        An API is an alternative to the UI.
                        <br><br>
                        Smartphone UI have UI's that humans find easier to use. Machines have their own as well however a human wouldn't want to use that kind of UI.<br><br>
                        API's are used by the software on your machine to access information on other machines. Your smartphone could also send an API request to a server across the network to access information on there.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand it could be two servers talking to each other. Maybe you have something like SAP(Systems Applications Products) talking through the network to a ecommerce site to exchange some information through networkable API's.
                        <br><br>
